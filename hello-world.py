# There are two versions of python 
# python2 and python3
# There are major differences with both the versions
# Eg: print directive
# In python2, print is not a function and therefore it is invoked without parentheses
# However in python3, it is a function and must be invoked with parentheses

print("Hello, World!")


# Indentation
# -----------
# python uses indentation for blocks instead of curly braces
# standard indentation uses 4 spaces

x = 1
if x == 1:
    print("x is 1")
